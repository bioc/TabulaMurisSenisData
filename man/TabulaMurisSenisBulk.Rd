\title{Access the Tabula Muris Senis bulk RNA-seq data}
\usage{
TabulaMurisSenisBulk()
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object with a single matrix of
  counts.
}
\description{
Access the bulk RNA-seq data from the Tabula Muris Senis consortium.
}
\details{
The data set was downloaded from GEO (accession number GSE132040). The
summary statistics from HTSeq-count were combined with the provided sample
metadata and included in the colData of the object. In addition,
gene annotations from GENCODE vM19 were downloaded and included in the
rowRanges of the object.
